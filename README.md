# future-membership

[Fractal](https://fractal.build/) component library for future membership work

Requirements: NodeJS 4.4.7+

## Installation

First, check out repository (https://github.com/coopdigital/future-membership.git) on your machine, and navigate to the repository root in a terminal window.

Install the Fractal CLI helper globally

```sh
$ npm i -g @frctl/fractal
```

Install node dependencies (`gulp-cli` needs to be installed globally):

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

## Start local server

Start Fractal & Gulp locally.

This triggers file watching and browser syncing, which means your local dev site will auto-update with changes.

```sh
$ ./start.sh
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
